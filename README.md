This repo contains a collection of PowerShell and Bash scripts Iâ€™ve developed and used in real-world 3rd line support and infrastructure operations. These scripts have been used to automate repetitive tasks, improve monitoring, and enhance team efficiency across hybrid Windows/Linux environments.
